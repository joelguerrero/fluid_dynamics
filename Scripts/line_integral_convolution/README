1. First, install lic_internal python module by following readme in setup/ directory

2. In order to run lic_flow.py, you need dependencies:

   python-sympy
   python-numpy
   python-matplotlib
   python-scipy

3. Edit config.py  with desired configuration (function to plot, etc.)
4. Run lic_flow.py.  If you denoted that branch cuts may be present this could take a long time, depending on resolution (2000x2000 resolution takes about 10 minutes on my computer)
5. Enjoy your beautiful image
